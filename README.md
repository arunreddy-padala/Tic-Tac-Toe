- The TicTacToeController interface includes two primary methods:
      - playGame(TicTacToeModel model): Executes a single game session of Tic-Tac-Toe using the provided model. This method terminates once the game concludes.
      - handleCellClick(int row, int col): Manages actions performed on individual cells, such as making a move on the board.
   
- The TicTacToeView interface comprises three essential methods:
      - addClickListener(TicTacToeController controller): Sets up the controller to handle click events within the view.
      - refresh(): Updates the view to reflect any changes in the game's state.
      - makeVisible(): Displays the view to initiate the game session.

- Extends the JPanel class and overrides the paintComponent method to render the game board and display game status, including whose turn it is and the gameâ€™s outcome (win, lose, or draw).

- Extends the MouseAdapter class and override the mouseClicked method to capture clicks on the game board, then relay this information to the controller for processing.
